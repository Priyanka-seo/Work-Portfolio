# Work-Portfolio
3RI Technologies operates in a highly competitive education niche with multiple technical courses targeting the same local market (Pune).
The challenge was not just ranking individual pages, but building consistent visibility across courses, improving local presence, and positioning the brand for AI-driven search results.

# SEO Objectives
- Improve first-page visibility for high-intent course keywords
- Strengthen Local SEO presence (Maps + organic)
- Expand keyword coverage across multiple technologies
- Build brand/entity authority for AI Overview inclusion
- Achieve sustainable organic growth, not traffic spikes

# SEO Strategy Applied
Rather than relying on a single tactic, the SEO approach focused on scalable fundamentals:
- Search intent mapping for course, certification, and placement-based queries
- Structured on-page optimization (headings, internal linking, semantic relevance)
- Local SEO optimization for Pune-based searches
- Content refinement using Google Search Console insights
- Consistent entity signals across content and brand mentions
- Built a natural backlink profile with a healthy follow/nofollow mix
- Focused on authority signals that support both traditional search and AI-driven results
