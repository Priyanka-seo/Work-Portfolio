- Optimized for **search intent** (course, certification, placement-focused queries)
- Scalable SEO execution across **multiple technologies & categories**

This reflects a **strategy-driven SEO approach**, not isolated keyword wins.

**Key SEO outcomes demonstrated:**
- Google recognizes **3RI Technologies as a trusted local education entity**
- Content is optimized for **AI-driven SERPs**, not just traditional rankings

## 📊 Organic Search Performance (28 Days vs 3 Months)

This shows steady organic growth built over time, with search visibility increasing consistently across multiple queries. Over a 3-month period, impressions crossed **1.8M**, supported by a clear upward trend in clicks, indicating stronger keyword coverage and improved relevance in Google Search.

The growth reflects ongoing SEO efforts focused on content optimization, query intent alignment, and broader SERP coverage rather than short-term traffic spikes.

### What worked here :

- Mapping content to **search intent**, not just keywords  
- Strengthening **on-page structure** so pages perform across multiple queries  
- Using **Search Console data** to identify opportunity gaps and refine content  
- Allowing SEO to **compound over time** instead of forcing short-term wins  

This is the kind of growth that may look slow on a weekly chart — but proves strong and sustainable on a quarterly view.
