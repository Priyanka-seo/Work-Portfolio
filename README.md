### 📊 Keyword Ranking Impact (Local + Organic SEO)

This snapshot highlights the **organic and local SEO growth achieved for 3RI Technologies**, where multiple **high-intent course keywords** (Python, Data Science, React, Cybersecurity, Salesforce, Tosca) rank on **Google’s first page and Local Pack**.

**Key SEO outcomes demonstrated:**
- Consistent **Top SERP visibility** for competitive education keywords in Pune
- Strong **Local SEO presence** (Google Maps + organic listings)
- Optimized for **search intent** (course, certification, placement-focused queries)
- Scalable SEO execution across **multiple technologies & categories**

This reflects a **strategy-driven SEO approach**, not isolated keyword wins.
